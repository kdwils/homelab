                            newest version of an image. No regular expressions or glob patterns are
                            supported yet. This field is optional.

                            the same as SemVer). This field is also optional. When left unspecified,
                            (and the ImageSelectionStrategy is SemVer or unspecified), there will be no
                            constraints, which means the latest semantically tagged version of an image
                            will always be used. Care should be taken with leaving this field
                            unspecified, as it can lead to the unanticipated rollout of breaking
                            changes. Refer to Image Updater documentation for more details.
